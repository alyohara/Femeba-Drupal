*README // ZERO POINT theme for Drupal 8, 9 and 10.*

Thank you for downloading this theme!


ABOUT THE 0 POINT THEME:
===========================

**Zero Point** is an advanced responsive, mobile first, HTML5 theme with layout and style configuration options built in that you can control through Drupal's UI. The theme is a highly customized and feature-rich design that goes beyond the basic look and feel of a typical Drupal website. It uses [Yahoo Pure.css](https://purecss.io), a powerful responsive CSS framework and also fully supports right to left languages. Pure is ridiculously tiny. The entire set of modules clocks in at 3.5KB minified and gzipped.

The theme **validates HTML5 and CSS3**, it is cross-browser compatible, and it complies with [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) and [FAE](https://fae.cita.uiuc.edu/).

**8.x-1.x** is a complete redesign made with mobile and SEO in mind: compatible, light and fast.

Module support
----------------------------------------

This theme can support virtualy any module.

  
Theme customisation
----------------------------------------

If you feel like giving the theme a look of your own, I recommend to play with /_custom/custom-style.css; please read the comments in this file.

To change the rotating images in header you must replace the images in /_custom/headerimg or /_custom/headerimg-rtl with your own, naming them exactly like those in folder. As info, the image dimensions are 846x200 px. 
If you want to change header images rotator behaviour on mobile follow the instructions on the end of /_custom/custom-style.css.
